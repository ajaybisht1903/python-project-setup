# üåê Web Development

## `Flask`
**Purpose:** The `Flask` library is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.

**Example:**
```python app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## `Django`
**Purpose:** The `Django` library is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It includes numerous features that facilitate web development.

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a new Django project
django-admin startproject myproject

# Navigate to the project directory
cd myproject

# Create a new Django app
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

```python myproject/myapp/views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello_world(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
```

```python myproject/myproject/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from myapp.views import hello_world

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', hello_world),
]
```

## `FastAPI`
**Purpose:** The `FastAPI` library is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

**Example:**
```python app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

# To run the app, use the command: uvicorn app:app --reload
```

These libraries are essential for web development in Python, offering different levels of complexity and features to suit various needs.
