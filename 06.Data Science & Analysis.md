# ðŸ“Š Data Science & Analysis

## `pandas`
**Purpose:** The `pandas` library is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly.

**Example:**
```python data_manipulation.py
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Peter'],
    'Age': [28, 24, 35]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)
```

## `numpy`
**Purpose:** The `numpy` library is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.

**Example:**
```python numerical_computing.py
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform numerical operations
mean_value = np.mean(arr)
print(mean_value)
```

## `matplotlib`
**Purpose:** The `matplotlib` library is a plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

**Example:**
```python plotting.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple plot
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30, 40]
plt.plot(x, y)

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Sample Plot')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## `seaborn`
**Purpose:** The `seaborn` library is built on top of `matplotlib` and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

**Example:**
```python statistical_plots.py
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a histogram
data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
sns.histplot(data, kde=True)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

## `scikit-learn`
**Purpose:** The `scikit-learn` library is a powerful and efficient tool for machine learning and statistical modeling. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

**Example:**
```python machine_learning.py
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Sample data
X = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

## `statsmodels`
**Purpose:** The `statsmodels` library provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests and statistical data exploration.

**Example:**
```python statistical_modeling.py
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Sample data
X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Add a constant to the predictor
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Create and fit the model
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Print the summary
print(model.summary())
```

These libraries are essential for data science and analysis in Python, offering a wide range of tools for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
