# üñ•Ô∏è GUI Development

## `Tkinter`
**Purpose:** The `Tkinter` library is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is built into Python and is used for creating graphical user interfaces.

**Example:**
```python gui_tkinter.py
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Hello World")

# Create a label widget
label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, World!")
label.pack()

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
```

## `PyQt`
**Purpose:** The `PyQt` library is a set of Python bindings for The Qt Company's Qt application framework. It is used for creating advanced graphical user interfaces.

**Example:**
```python gui_pyqt.py
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QLabel

# Create the application
app = QApplication(sys.argv)

# Create the main window
window = QWidget()
window.setWindowTitle("Hello World")

# Create a label widget
label = QLabel("Hello, World!", window)
label.move(50, 50)

# Show the window
window.show()

# Run the application
sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

## `Kivy`
**Purpose:** The `Kivy` library is an open-source Python library for developing multitouch applications. It is designed to work on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

**Example:**
```python gui_kivy.py
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import Label

class HelloWorldApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return Label(text='Hello, World!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    HelloWorldApp().run()
```

These libraries are essential for GUI development in Python, offering different levels of complexity and features to suit various needs.
